## Target Non-retraining Ternary
This is a Demo of Target Non-retraining Ternary (TNT) implementation of for the MNIST dataset, and the model structure is LeNet-5. This demo contains three models, which are full precision model, ternary model, and ternary model with scalar-tuning.

## Requirements
Python, Keras, Tensorflow

## Usage
$ git clone https://github.com/tenngreZ/TNT-models.git
$ jupyter notebook

## Precision Comparsion

In the mode_comparsion,ipynb, it shows the cosine similarity between full precision and ternary model
