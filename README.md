## Target Non-retraining Ternary
This is a Demo of Target Non-retraining Ternary (TNT) implementation of for the MNIST dataset, and the model structure is LeNet-5. This demo contains three models, which are full precision model, ternary model, and ternary model with scalar-tuning.

## Requirements
Python, Keras, Tensorflow, cv2

## Precision Comparsion

In the TNT_mnist_model.ipynb, it shows the cosine similarity between full precision with ternary model and ternary model with scalar-tuning.

## Usage
git clone git@github.com:tenngreZ/TNT-MNIST-models.git
